# Loop 2 failure-mode follow-up (first token vs continuation)

This memo decomposes the current Loop 2 behavior into two pieces using already-generated control artifacts:

1. **early target selection** — `mean_first_prob`, `mean_first_entry_correct`
2. **whole-word continuation** — `mean_exact_match`, `mean_akshara_cer`, plus copy-style error patterns

## Key takeaways

- **Established:** `1B × Hindi × n_icl=64` is already failing at the **first target token**. Helpful ICL is worse than zero-shot on first-token probability (0.481 vs 0.579) and first-entry correctness (0.500 vs 0.600).
- **Established:** `1B × Telugu × n_icl=64` is **not** primarily a first-token failure. Helpful ICL drives first-token probability from 0.002 to 0.869 and first-entry correctness from 0.000 to 0.900, yet exact match stays at 0.000.
- **Established:** `1B × Telugu × n_icl=64` often emits an **ICL target string** rather than the query-specific answer: 80.0% of helpful predictions are exact copies of one of the prompt-bank targets, and 88.9% of the `first-correct but exact-wrong` cases are bank copies.
- **Established:** `1B × Hindi × n_icl=64` often falls back to **Latin/source-like outputs**: 50.0% of helpful predictions are Latin-script, and 40.0% are exact source copies.
- **Supported but provisional:** `4B × Telugu × n_icl=64` is a clean positive anchor because it gets both stages right: first-token probability rises to 0.979, first-entry correctness to 0.967, and exact match to 0.300; its residual errors are mostly near-misses rather than prompt-bank copies (6.7%).
- **Supported but provisional:** `4B × Hindi × n_icl=64` is a strong-base-capability comparison cell, not a rescue-heavy cell: zero-shot is already strong (exact 0.367), and helpful ICL mostly sharpens first-token confidence rather than creating a new regime.

## Failure-mode interpretation

### 1B Hindi: early target-selection failure

Observed at `n_icl=64`: helpful ICL is worse than zero-shot on first-token probability (0.481 vs 0.579), worse on first-entry correctness (0.500 vs 0.600), and worse on exact match (0.000 vs 0.067).

Helpful outputs are often not even in the right script: 50.0% Latin-script predictions, 40.0% exact source copies.

This points to a **routing / target-selection problem before whole-word continuation**, not just a later suffix-composition issue.

Representative failures:

- `aadeshpaalak` → gold `आदेशपालक` but predicted `आदेशप्रताप` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aadhikarik` → gold `आधिकरिक` but predicted `आधिपतिक` (bank copy: `False`)
- `aabhyantarikaran` → gold `आभ्यंतरीकरण` but predicted `आभ्यन्तरिकृत` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aadhyatmakta` → gold `आध्यात्मकता` but predicted `आध्यदेश` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aadarahi` → gold `आदरही` but predicted `आदिशक्तिका` (bank copy: `True`)

### 1B Telugu: continuation / retrieval-composition failure

Observed at `n_icl=64`: helpful ICL greatly improves first-token probability (0.002 → 0.869) and first-entry correctness (0.000 → 0.900), but exact match stays at `0.000`.

The dominant error mode is prompt-bank copying: 80.0% of helpful predictions are exact copies of one of the 64 prompt-bank targets.

Among the items where the model gets the first entry correct but still misses the whole word, 88.9% are bank copies. This is much closer to **retrieving the wrong full answer from the prompt bank** than to failing to choose the target script.

Representative failures:

- `aadaallameeda` → gold `ఆడాళ్ళమీద` but predicted `ఆడాళ్లదీ` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aacharanaatmakathatho` → gold `ఆచరణాత్మకతతో` but predicted `ఆచరణాత్మకమైనదో` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aacharanaatmamgaa` → gold `ఆచరణాత్మంగా` but predicted `ఆచరించడం` (bank copy: `False`)
- `aacharinchabadedi` → gold `ఆచరించబడేది` but predicted `ఆచరింపదగిన` (bank copy: `True`)
- `aabharanamgaano` → gold `ఆభరణంగానో` but predicted `ఆభరణాల్లోనో` (bank copy: `True`)

### 4B Telugu: the clean anchor remains clean

`4B × Telugu × n_icl=64` improves both early and late metrics. Helpful exact match reaches 0.300, while helpful bank-copy rate is only 6.7%. Residual errors are usually near-misses rather than verbatim prompt-bank retrieval.

## Addendum: first-token audit and nearest-neighbor copy ranks

A separate bounded audit on the VM (`research/results/autoresearch/first_token_competition_v1/results/summary.json`) confirms and sharpens the earlier stage split.

- **1B Hindi first-token stage:** under `icl_helpful`, top-1 first-token accuracy falls to `0.467` (vs `0.600` in zero-shot), and the top-1 token is **Latin-script in 50% of items**. The most common failed first-token competitor is plain Latin `a`-like continuations (`a`, `aa`, `aad`).
- **Important nuance:** `icl_corrupt` is similarly bad at the first token for `1B Hindi` (`top1_target_rate = 0.433`), so this early-routing failure is not strongly content-specific. It looks like a high-shot prompt-state / routing pathology more than a helpful-example benefit that simply went wrong.
- **1B Telugu first-token stage:** under `icl_helpful`, top-1 first-token accuracy rises to `0.900` and mean target-token probability to `0.869`; even `icl_corrupt` reaches `0.767`. So the first-token fix is mostly present before exact-match success appears.
- **Important nuance:** `4B Telugu` shows the same pattern even more strongly: `icl_helpful` and `icl_corrupt` both reach `top1_target_rate = 0.967`, but only helpful examples deliver the stronger whole-word exact-match behavior. This reinforces that the first-token stage is not the whole story.
- **Prompt-bank copy rank analysis:** for `1B Telugu`, copied bank targets are usually drawn from the **similarity-neighborhood** of the query rather than from arbitrary prompt positions. At `n_icl=64`, `24/30` helpful predictions are exact bank copies; among those copied targets, the matched example has median source-similarity rank `2.5`, `62.5%` are in the top 5, and `75%` are in the top 10. The copy rate also rises with `n_icl` (`53.3% -> 70.0% -> 80.0%` for `48 -> 56 -> 64`).
- **Condition comparison on the same Telugu items:**
  - `icl_helpful_similarity_desc` still copies bank targets heavily (`73.3%`), and the copied targets become even more concentrated on the nearest neighbors (median rank `1.0`, top-5 share `81.8%`).
  - `icl_helpful_similarity_asc` cuts the copy rate sharply (`23.3%`) but also hurts first-token quality and CER, which suggests similarity ordering is doing real work, not just adding noise.
  - `icl_helpful_reversed` lands in between (`50.0%` copy rate), again consistent with order affecting *which* similar bank item gets retrieved.
  - `icl_corrupt` still has a very high bank-copy rate (`83.3%`), but those copied targets are **not** usually nearest neighbors under the true source-query similarity ranking (median rank `22`, top-5 share only `12%`). This indicates a second, more generic high-shot bank-copy tendency when source-target alignment is broken.
- **4B Telugu comparison:** only `2/30` helpful predictions are exact bank copies, though when they happen they come from the very top nearest-neighbor rank.

This makes the current best explanation:

- `1B Hindi`: an early routing failure in which high-shot ICL often pushes the model toward Latin/source-like first-token competitors.
- `1B Telugu`: a later nearest-neighbor-style retrieval/composition failure in which the model often selects the right script and first token but then emits a similar in-context target string instead of the query-specific answer.
- `4B Telugu`: the clean anchor because it escapes both failure modes often enough to turn early token selection into correct whole-word continuation.

## Manual spot-check audit

I then manually spot-checked representative raw examples against the automated summaries.

### 1B Hindi

The aggregate claim survives manual inspection, but with an important nuance.

- Cases like `aaegi`, `aadesho`, `aafatakaal`, `aahalya`, and `aachegaav` really do show the early-routing failure directly: the generated answer stays Latin/source-like, and the first-token audit shows the top token flipping from the intended Devanagari `आ` in zero-shot to Latin tokens like `aa`, `a`, or `ah` under high-shot ICL.
- But the failure is **not only** early. Cases like `aadeshpaalak`, `aadhyatmakta`, and `aagyakarita` have the correct first Devanagari token under helpful ICL and still end on the wrong whole word. So the cleanest honest wording is: `1B Hindi` has a **substantial early routing failure**, not a purely first-token-only failure.

### 1B Telugu

The Telugu claim also survives manual inspection.

- Cases like `aadaallameeda`, `aacharanaatmakathatho`, `aabharanamgaano`, `aadaayapannulasaakha`, `aadaayaalaina`, and `aadaamannadaanipaine` all get the first token right under helpful ICL (`ఆ` beats `అ` from zero-shot), but then generate a wrong bank-like target such as `ఆడాళ్లదీ`, `ఆచరణాత్మకమైనదో`, or `ఆదాయపన్నుశాఖలో`.
- The nearest-neighbor story looks real on inspection, not just in the aggregate counts: several copied outputs are the top-1 or top-2 similarity matches in the prompt bank.
- There are still exceptions (`aabraham`, `aachaaryulandaruu`) where helpful ICL fails already at the first token, so the Telugu cell is not perfectly pure. But the dominant pattern is still later retrieval/composition failure.

### 4B Telugu

The positive-anchor claim also survives manual inspection.

- Representative wrong cases such as `aadaallameeda`, `aacharanaatmakathatho`, `aadaayaalaina`, and `aacharinchaalsina` usually have the correct first token and look like close morphological near-misses rather than arbitrary prompt-bank copies.
- The two bank-copy cases I checked (`ఆభరణంగానూ`, `ఆదాయాలైనా`) are both very near neighbors, but they are rare compared with the `1B` regime.

Overall, the manual audit did **not** overturn the automated conclusions. It mostly tightened the wording:

- `1B Hindi`: substantial early routing failure, plus some later whole-word failures.
- `1B Telugu`: mostly later retrieval/composition failure, with a minority of early failures.
- `4B Telugu`: near-miss regime rather than prompt-bank-copy regime.

## Claim ledger

- **Established:** `1B × Hindi` high-shot fragility includes an early target-selection failure; helpful ICL often pushes the model toward Latin/source-like or wrong-bank outputs rather than toward the correct Devanagari target.
- **Established:** `1B × Telugu` high-shot fragility is mainly not a first-token problem; it is a continuation/retrieval-composition problem in which the model often emits a prompt-bank target string that matches the script and sometimes the first character, but not the query-specific transliteration.
- **Supported but provisional:** the `1B` story is therefore **not unitary** across languages. Hindi and Telugu appear to fail at different stages of the computation.
- **Supported but provisional:** visibility remains a contributing architectural factor, but these failure-mode differences show that visibility alone cannot explain the `1B` behavior.

## Recommended next bounded experiments

1. **1B Hindi — first-token competition audit.** Build a small teacher-forced probe that records the correct target token, the emitted top competitor token, and whether the competitor is Latin/source-like or a wrong Devanagari bank token. This directly tests the early-routing hypothesis.
2. **1B Telugu — prompt-bank copy audit with nearest-neighbor controls.** Measure how often the model outputs an in-context target exactly, and whether those copies correspond to the most orthographically similar prompt example rather than the correct answer. This directly tests the retrieval-composition hypothesis.
3. **Only after those two audits:** decide whether causal interventions should target early token selection (`1B Hindi`) or later query-specific continuation (`1B Telugu`).
